                    <p class="product-description">The blade Felix Lebrun Hyper Carbon is as extraordinary as its homonym. Developed with the experts from TIBHAR according to the wishes of the young penholder player from France. The blended fabric of layers of synthetic carbon fibres placed directly around the core veneer provides the high stiffness that a fast-attacking blade requires. This positioning, however, results in a longer and more sensitive contact with the ball, in contrast to the outer layers of fabric. This blade is perfectly adapted to players who privilege a fast and attacking game. The blade is ideal for a powerful attacking driving and looping game allowing you to both dominate and counter attack your opponent with total confidence and freedom.</p>
